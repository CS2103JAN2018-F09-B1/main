== Introduction

*Your TA* is for university teaching assistants who prefer to use a desktop application to manage student contacts and plan your schedule.
More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
If you can type fast, it can get your contact management and tasks scheduling done faster than traditional GUI applications. +
Once you're ready, jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `YourTA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The Login GUI should appear in a few seconds, as shown in Figure 1 below.
+
.The Login GUI upon double-clicking.
//dummy image, plz update this image
image::Login.png[width="800"]

.  Enter your `Username` and `Password` to log in. _Refer to <<Features>> for details of the feature._
.  After logging in, now you should see the main Application GUI in turn appear, as shown in Figure 2 below.

.The main Application GUI upon login.
//update this image also
image::UiInitial.png[width="800"]

.  The command box is where you type in commands followed by pressing kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window for the application.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts.
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the application.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Login Feature

Before you are able to access the application, login is required.
====
* Enter your `Username` and `Password` in the respective fields. +
* Click on the `login` button.
* If you have entered either of those incorrectly, the text "Wrong username or password entered" will be displayed. You have an unlimited number of tries to log in. +
* Upon successful login, the application will load with your previously saved data.
====

[NOTE]
Both `Username` and `Password` fields are case-sensitive.

[TIP]
If you are a first-time user, create an account by entering your desired `Username` and `Password` in the username and password text fields respectively. +
Then, click on the `Login` button.


== Contact Features

====
*Command Format*

* There are some equivalent shortcut commands known as _aliases_ with fewer alphabetic letters or a sign. +
e.g. to add a person to the addressbook, you can type 'add n/John Doe', 'a n/John Doe' or '+ n/John Doe'.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero). +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, or even not used at all.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Alias: `?` +
Format: `help`
[NOTE]
This opens a help window which explains what commands can be used, and how to use them.

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book. +
Alias: `a` and `+` +
Format: `add n/NAME m/MATRICULATION NUMBER p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS dp/[IMAGE PATH] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
Both the display picture and tags fields are optional, and a person can have any number of tags (including zero).

[NOTE]
====
** The tags "lecturer", "TA" "student" and "T1" will appear red, yellow, blue and green respectively.
** Do refrain from using high resolution images as display pictures, the optimum resolution is 300 x 300 pixels.
====

[WARNING]
The name field of Your TA will not allow duplicate names to be stored. However the matriculation number field allows duplicates.

Examples:

The address book initially starts with default inputs as displayed in Figure 2:

.Initial Address Book State +
image::UiInitial.png[width="800"]

Let's try entering a command, such as the one below: +

Command entered: +
`add n/John Doe m/A0111111X p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 dp/C:\Users\Name\Desktop\John.jpg`: +
[NOTE]
The filepath after the `dp/` depends on where your image file is located.
This will add a person, 'John Doe' into the list with his respective details into the application (Figure 3).

.Application after John Doe has been Added +
image::UiAfterFirst.png[width="800"]

Command entered: +
